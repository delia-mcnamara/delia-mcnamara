Hi, I'm Delia.
👩‍💻 I'm a data scientist. I'm just getting started, but I'm already knowledgable on some key exploratory data analysis & statistical analysis skills. 
✔️ I'm looking forward to improving my abilities in Data Science - particularly machine learning - and showcasing them here. 
🧬🦐 I've worked as a supervisor in Research & Development for a shrimp genetics company, where I handled & analyzed large datasets & managed 20+ ongoing projects & trials at a time. 
🐠🔢 I have a Master's degree in Marine Biology & completed the MIT Applied Data Science course in August of 2024.
